Page Configuration and Header:

The code sets the title of the web page to "Ask your PDF" using Streamlit's set_page_config function.
It displays a header with the title "Ask your ScanScript Ai ðŸ’¬".

Sidebar:

The code creates a sidebar using Streamlit's sidebar function.
It includes information about the LLM Chat App, such as its purpose and the technologies used.
The sidebar also acknowledges the team that built the app.

PDF Upload:

Users can upload PDF files using the file uploader provided by Streamlit (file_uploader function).

Text Extraction:

If a PDF file is uploaded, the code extracts the text from the PDF using the PdfReader class from the PyPDF2 library.
It concatenates the text from all pages into a single string.

Text Splitting:

The code splits the extracted text into smaller chunks for processing.
It uses the CharacterTextSplitter class from the LangChain library to split the text into chunks of 1000 characters with an overlap of 200 characters.
Embeddings and Knowledge Base Creation:

The code creates embeddings for each text chunk using OpenAI's embeddings.
It creates a knowledge base using the FAISS library, which allows for efficient similarity search based on embeddings.

User Input:

Users can input questions about the uploaded PDF using a text input field.

Question Answering:

When a user inputs a question, the code performs a similarity search on the knowledge base to find relevant text chunks.
It then uses LangChain's question-answering module to generate a response based on the user's question and the retrieved text chunks.

Displaying Response:

The generated response is displayed to the user using Streamlit's write function.

Overall, the code creates a web-based chatbot application that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about the content of the PDF. The application uses LangChain and OpenAI's LLM model to analyze the text and provide relevant answers to the user's questions.
